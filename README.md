garmin-connect-export
=====================

Downloads gpx, tcx or original fit files from your Garmin Connect Account (Mainland of China) in [connect.garmin.cn](connect.garmin.cn).

Description
-----------
This script downloads gpx, tcx or original fit files from your personal Garmin Connect Account.

All downloaded data will go into a working directory called `YYYY-MM-DD_garmin_connect_export/`.

Activity details like activity title or activity description will be persisted using the Activity ID in a separate JSON file called `activities.json`. This JSON can be used for parsing data towards additional data sources.

If there is no GPS track data (e.g., due to an indoor treadmill workout), a data file will still be saved.
If the GPX format is used, activity title and description data will be saved.
If the original format is used, Garmin may not provide a file at all and an empty file will be created.
For activities where a GPX file was uploaded, Garmin may not have a TCX file available for download, so an empty file will be created.
Since GPX is the only format Garmin should have for every activity, it is the default and preferred download format.
If you have thousands of activities you may run into an "operation timed out" message. Just re-run it again. It will pick up where it left off.

Usage
-----
To get it actually flying you might need a tiny bit of experience running things from the command line. If you read the term "terminal" for the very first time or googled "running things from command line" already in another browser tab, it will be challenging to get it finally working.

Having that said, here are the usage details from the `--help` flag:

```
usage:

    gcexport.py [-h] [--version] [--username [USERNAME]]
                [--password [PASSWORD]] [-c [COUNT]]
                [-f [{gpx,tcx,original}]] [-d [DIRECTORY]] [-u]

optional arguments:

    -h, --help
    
        show this help message and exit
    
    --version
    
        print version and exit
    
    --username [USERNAME]
    
        your Garmin Connect username
        otherwise, you will be prompted
    
    --password [PASSWORD]
    
        your Garmin Connect password
        otherwise, you will be prompted
    
    -c [COUNT], --count [COUNT]
    
        number of recent activities to download, limit is 1000
        default: 1
    
    -f [{gpx,tcx,original}], --format [{gpx,tcx,original}]
    
        export format; can be 'gpx', 'tcx', or 'original'
        default: 'gpx'
        
    -d [DIRECTORY], --directory [DIRECTORY]
    
        the directory to export to
        default: './YYYY-MM-DD_garmin_connect_export'
        
    -u, --unzip
    
        if downloading zip files (format: 'original')
        unzipping files and removing zip file
```

Examples
--------
`python gcexport.py -d ~/MyActivities -c 3 -f original -u --username mygarminusername --password mygarminpassword`

downloads your 3 most recent activities in the FIT file format (or whatever they were uploaded as) into the `~/MyActivities` directory (unless they already exist)

Dislaimer

Using the `--username` and `--password` flags are not recommended because your password will be stored in your command line history. Instead, omit them to be prompted (and note that nothing will be displayed when you type your password).

Python
------
Alternatively, you may run it with `./gcexport.py` if you set the file as executable (i.e., `chmod u+x gcexport.py`). This requires Python. Luckly most Mac and Linux users should already have it. Beside that and as already mentioned above some basic command line experience might be helpful.

`python /mygarminconnectexportscriptfolder/gcexport.py -d /mygarminconnectexportsfolder -c "mynumberofexports" -f original -u --username "mygarminusername" --password "mygarminpassword"`

executes from command line, downloads the definied number of original FIT files to your destination folder

JSON Data
---------
If you want to see all raw data Garmin Connect hands to this script, just print out the contents of the `json_results` variable. This should might be most useful for parsing data to other data sources.

But still, some information might be missing, such as your "Favorites" from Garmin Connect. Unfortunately this is only available from the Garmin Connect web interface and simply not included in data given into this script.

Also, be careful with speed data as it is sometimes measured as a pace (minutes per mile) or as a speed (miles per hour).

Contributions
-------------
Contributions are warmly welcome, particularly if this script stops working with Garmin Connect. You may consider opening a GitHub issue first. New features, however simple, are encouraged.

Golden Cheetah & Garmin Connect
-------------------------------
You are a runner, cyclist or triathlete? You love Golden Cheetah? You track your activities with Garmin devices? You want to download all of them from Garmin Connect? Okay, this got answered already within here.

But now, you want to archive, cloud-backup and import automatically into Golden Cheetah? There are tons of alternatives and workarounds. Here is mine.

Thank You
---------
Other than that, thx for using this script.

DISCLAIMER
----------
No Guarantee

This script does NOT guarantee to get all your data or even download it correctly. Against my Garmin Connect account it works quite fine and smooth, but different Garmin Connect account settings or different data types could potentially cause problems.

Garmin Connect API

This is NOT an official feature of Garmin Connect, Garmin may very well make changes to their APIs that breaks this script (and they certainly did since this project got created for several times).

THIS SCRIPT IS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY

It simulates a standard user session (i.e., in the browser), logging in using cookies and an authorization ticket. This makes the script pretty brittle. If you're looking for a more reliable option, particularly if you wish to use this for some production service, Garmin does offer a paid API service.

Security Dislaimer

Using the `--username` and `--password` flags are not recommended because your password will be stored in your command line history. Instead, omit them to be prompted (and note that nothing will be displayed when you type your password).
